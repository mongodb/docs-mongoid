Congratulations on completing the Quick Start tutorial for Sinatra!

After you complete these steps, you have a Sinatra web application that
uses {+odm+} to connect to your MongoDB deployment, run a query on
the sample data, and render retrieved results.

.. TODO You can download the completed web application project by cloning the
.. `mongoid-quickstart <>`__
.. GitHub repository.

.. TODO Learn more about {+odm+} features from the following resources:

.. - :ref:`mongoid-fundamentals-connection`: learn how to configure your MongoDB
..   connection.
.. 
.. - :ref:`mongoid-usage-examples`: see code examples of frequently used MongoDB
..   operations.
