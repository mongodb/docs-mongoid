Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to specify a **query** by using {+odm+}.

You can refine the set of documents that a query returns by creating a
**query filter**. A query filter is an expression that specifies the search
criteria MongoDB uses to match documents in a read or write operation.
When creating a query filter, you can prompt the driver to search for
documents with an exact match to your query, or you can compose query
filters to express more complex matching criteria.

{+odm+} provides a query domain-specific language (DSL) similar to the
one used in Active Record.

Sample Data
~~~~~~~~~~~

The examples in this guide use the ``Band`` model, which represents a
band or musical group. The definition of the ``Band`` model might be
different for each section to demonstrate different query
functionalities. Some sections might also use the ``Manager`` model,
which represents a person who manages a given band, or a ``Show`` model, which
represents a live performance by a certain band or musical group.

Queries in {+odm+}
------------------

{+odm+} query methods return ``Mongoid::Criteria`` objects, which are
chainable and lazily evaluated wrappers for the MongoDB Query API.
The queries are executed when you iterate through the results. The
following example demonstrates the return type for a simple query:

.. code-block:: ruby

  # Creates a simple query
  Band.where(name: "Deftones")
  
  # Returns a Criteria object
  # => #<Mongoid::Criteria
  #   selector: {"name"=>"Deftones"}
  #   options:  {}
  #   class:    Band
  #   embedded: false>

  # Evaluate the query by converting to JSON
  Band.where(name: "Deftones").to_json
  
  # Returns matching documents
  # => [{"_id":"...","name":"Deftones"}]

You can use methods such as ``first()`` and ``last()`` to return
individual documents. You can also iterate a ``Criteria`` object by using
methods such as ``each()`` or ``map()`` to retrieve documents from the
server. You can use ``to_json()`` to convert a ``Criteria`` object to
JSON.

.. tip:: Chaining methods

   If you chain other query methods on an existing ``Criteria`` object,
   {+odm+} merges the filter criteria.

Create a Query Filter 
---------------------

This section describes the syntax patterns that you can use to create
filter criteria. You can specify queries in {+odm+} by using any of the
following syntax patterns:

- Field syntax
- Query API syntax
- Symbol operator syntax

.. note:: Syntax Behaviors
    
   These syntaxes support querying embedded documents by using dot notation.
   The syntaxes also respect :ref:`field aliases <mongoid-query-field-alias>`
   and field types, if the field being queried is defined in the model class.

The examples in this section use the following model definition:

.. code-block:: ruby

   class Band
     include Mongoid::Document
 
     field :name, type: String
     field :founded, type: Integer
     field :m, as: :member_count, type: Integer
 
     embeds_one :manager
   end
 
   class Manager
     include Mongoid::Document
 
     embedded_in :band
 
     field :name, type: String
   end

Field Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~

The field querying syntax uses the basic {+language+} hashes. The keys
can be symbols or strings and correspond to field names in MongoDB
documents.

The following code shows two equivalent queries that use field querying
syntax to retrieve documents in which the ``name`` field value is
``'Depeche Mode'``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-simple-field-query
   :end-before: end-simple-field-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Query API Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify a Query API operator on any field by using the hash
syntax, as shown by the following equivalent queries:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-query-api-query
   :end-before: end-query-api-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Symbol Operator Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify Query API operators as methods on symbols for the
respective field name, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-symbol-query
   :end-before: end-symbol-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Query on Different Field Types
------------------------------

This section describes how to perform queries on fields with different
types of values.

Defined Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO add link to Fields page

To query on a field, the field does not need to be in the
the model class definition. However, if a field is defined in
the model class, {+odm+} coerces query values to match the defined field
types when constructing the query.

The following code specifies a string value when querying on the
``founded`` field. Because the ``founded`` field is defined in the model
class to have ``Integer`` values, {+odm+} coerces the string ``'2020'``
to ``2020`` when performing the query:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-defined-field-query
   :end-before: end-defined-field-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Raw Values
~~~~~~~~~~

To bypass {+odm+}'s query type coercion behavior and query
directly for the raw-typed value in the database, wrap the query value in
the ``Mongoid::RawValue`` class, as shown in the following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-raw-field-query
   :end-before: end-raw-field-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

.. _mongoid-query-field-alias:

Field Aliases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. TODO update links

Queries follow the :ref:`storage field names <storage-field-names>`
and :ref:`field aliases <field-aliases>` that you might have set in your
model class definition.

The ``id`` and ``_id`` fields are aliases, so you can use either field
name in queries:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-id-field-query
   :end-before: end-id-field-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Embedded Documents
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To query on values of fields of embedded documents, you can use dot
notation. The following code retrieves documents in which the ``name``
field of the embedded ``Manager`` document is ``'Smith'``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-embedded-query
   :end-before: end-embedded-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

The following code demonstrates how to use a symbol operator when
querying on an embedded field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-embedded-ne-query
   :end-before: end-embedded-ne-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

.. note::

   Queries always return top-level model instances, even if all the
   conditions reference embedded document fields.

.. _mongoid-query-logical-operations:

Logical Operations
------------------

{+odm+} supports the following logical operations on ``Criteria``
objects:

- ``and()``
- ``or()``
- ``nor()``
- ``not()``

These methods take one or more hashes of conditions or another
``Criteria`` object as their arguments. The ``not()`` operation has an
argument-free version.

The following code demonstrates how to use the logical operations in
queries:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-logical-ops
   :end-before: end-logical-ops
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

.. note:: Array Parameters

   To ensure backwards compatibility with earlier {+odm+} versions, the
   logical operation methods accept arrays of parameters, which are
   flattened to obtain the criteria.
   
   Passing arrays to logical operations is deprecated and might be removed
   in a future version.

The following queries produce the same conditions:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-logical-and-ops
   :end-before: end-logical-and-ops
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Operator Combinations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The logical operators have the the same semantics as those from Active
Record. 

When conditions are specified on the same field multiple times, all
conditions are added to the criteria, as shown by the queries in the
following code:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-logical-combination-ops
   :end-before: end-logical-combination-ops
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

The ``any_of()``, ``none_of()``, ``nor()``, and ``not()`` operations
behave similarly.

When you use ``and()``, ``or()``, and ``nor()`` logical operators, they
operate on the criteria built up to that point:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-logical-combination-ops-2
   :end-before: end-logical-combination-ops-2
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

not() Behavior
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can use the ``not()`` method without arguments, in which case it
negates the next condition that is specified. The ``not()`` method can
be called with one or more hash conditions or ``Criteria`` objects,
which are all negated and added to the criteria.

The following examples demonstrate the behavior of ``not()``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-not-logical
   :end-before: end-not-logical
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

.. note::
   
   You cannot use the ``$not`` operator in MongoDB with a string argument.
   Mongoid uses the ``$ne`` operator to achieve negation:

   .. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
      :start-after: start-not-logical-note
      :end-before: end-not-logical-note
      :language: ruby
      :dedent:

Similarly to ``and()``, the ``not()`` operation negates individual
conditions for simple field criteria. For complex conditions and when a
field already has a condition defined on it, {+odm+} emulates ``$not``
by using an ``{'$and' => [{'$nor' => ...}]}`` construct, because MongoDB
supports the ``$not`` operator only on a per-field basis rather than
globally:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-not-behavior
   :end-before: end-not-behavior
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

If you are using ``not()`` with arrays or regular expressions, view the
limitations of ``$not`` in the :manual:`{+server-manual+}
</reference/operator/query/not/>`.

Incremental Query Construction
------------------------------

By default, when you add conditions to a query, {+odm+} considers each
condition complete and independent from any other conditions
present in the query. For example, calling ``in()`` twice adds two separate
``$in`` conditions:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-incremental-1
   :end-before: end-incremental-1
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Some operator methods support building the condition incrementally. When
you add a condition which uses one of the supported operators, {+odm+}
sees if there already is a condition on the same field using the
same operator. If so, the operator expressions are combined according to the
specified *merge strategy*. The following section describes the available merge
strategies.

.. _mongoid-merge-strategies:

Merge Strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

{+odm+} provides the following merge strategies:

- **Override**: The new operator instance replaces any existing
  conditions on the same field by using the same operator.
- **Intersect**: If there already is a condition using the same operator
  on the same field, the values of the existing condition are
  intersected with the values of the new condition and the result is
  stored as the operator value.
- **Union**: If there already is a condition using the same operator on
  the same field, the values of the new condition are added to the
  values of the existing condition and the result is stored as the
  operator value.

The following code demonstrates how the merge strategies produce
criteria by using ``in()`` as the example operator:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-in-merge
   :end-before: end-in-merge
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

The strategy is requested by calling ``override()``, ``intersect()`` or ``union()``
on a ``Criteria`` instance. The requested strategy applies to the next
condition method called on the query. If the next condition method called does
not support merge strategies, the strategy is reset, as shown in the following
example:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-merge-reset
   :end-before: end-merge-reset
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Because ``ne()`` does not support merge strategies, the ``union`` strategy
is ignored and reset. Then, when ``in()`` is invoked the second time,
there is no active strategy.

.. warning::

   Merge strategies assume that the previous conditions have been added
   to the top level of the query. However, this is not always the case,
   as conditions might be nested under an ``$and`` clause. Using merge
   strategies with complex criteria can generate incorrect queries.

Supported Operator Methods
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The following operator methods support merge strategies:

- ``all()``
- ``in()``
- ``nin()``

The set of methods might be expanded in future releases of {+odm+}. To ensure
future compatibility, invoke a strategy method only when the next method call
is an operator that supports merge strategies.

Merge strategies are applied only when conditions are
added through the designated methods. In the following example, the
merge strategy is not applied because the second condition is added as
``where()``, not by using ``in()``:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-merge-where
   :end-before: end-merge-where
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

Operator Value Expansion
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Operator methods that support merge strategies take ``Array`` as their
value type. {+odm+} expands ``Array``-compatible types, such as a
``Range``, when they are used with these operator methods.

The following example demonstrates how you can pass a ``Range`` object
as the query value when using the ``in()`` method:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/interact-data/query.rb
   :start-after: start-range-query
   :end-before: end-range-query
   :language: ruby
   :dedent:

{+odm+} wraps non-``Array`` values in arrays,
as the shown in the following example:

.. code-block:: ruby

   Band.in(year: 1950)
   # Interpreted query: {"year"=>{"$in"=>[1950]}}
