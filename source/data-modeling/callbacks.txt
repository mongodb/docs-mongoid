Overview
--------

In this guide, you can learn how to implement **callbacks** in your
{+odm+} models to customize the life cycle of your model instances.

Callbacks are methods that {+odm+} triggers at specified moments of
an object's life cycle. They allow you to initiate specified actions
before or after changes to an object's state.

{+odm+} implements many of the callbacks from Active Record. To learn
more, see `Callbacks
<{+active-record-docs+}/active_record_callbacks.html>`__ in the
Active Record documentation.
