Overview
--------

Sharding is a way to distribute your data across multiple machines. MongoDB
uses sharding to support deployments with large data sets and high
throughput operations. In this guide, you can learn how to configure sharding in
your {+odm+} application.

Declare Shard keys
------------------

MongoDB uses shard keys to distribute a collection's documents across
shards. A shard key consists of one or more fields in a document. In your
{+odm+} application, you can declare a shard key when you create a model by
using the ``shard_key`` macro.

The following example creates a ``Person`` class with a shard key on the
``ssn`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/configuration/sharding.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-shard-key
   :end-before: # end-shard-key
   :emphasize-lines: 6

.. note::

   To shard a collection, the collection must have an index that starts with the
   shard key. You can use {+odm+}'s index management functionality to create the
   index. To learn more about index management with {+odm+}, see the :ref:`Index
   Management <mongoid-indexes>` guide.

If a model declares a shard key, {+odm+} expects the respective collection to be
sharded with the specified shard key. When {+odm+} reloads models, it provides
the shard key with the ``_id`` field to the ``find`` command to improve query
performance. If the collection is not sharded with the specified shard key,
queries might not return the expected results.

You can declare shard keys by using either the standard MongoDB
syntax, or by using a shorthand syntax.

Standard Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The standard syntax follows the format
of the ``mongosh`` :manual:`shardCollection()
</reference/method/sh.shardCollection>` method, and allows you to specify the
following types of shard keys:

- Ranged keys
- Hashed keys
- Compound keys

The standard syntax also allows you to specify collection and sharding options.

The following example creates a shard key on the ``ssn`` field in each of the
preceding formats:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/configuration/sharding.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-shard-key-formats
   :end-before: # end-shard-key-formats

Shorthand Syntax
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The shorthand syntax allows you to declare a shard key by specifying only the
field name. This syntax supports only ranged and compound shard keys, and does not allow you
to specify collection or sharding options.

The following example creates a ranged and a compound shard key:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/configuration/sharding.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-shard-key-shorthand
   :end-before: # end-shard-key-shorthand

Specify Associated and Embedded Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can specify a shard key on a ``belongs_to`` association in place of a field
name. When doing so, {+odm+} creates the shard key on the primary key of the
associated collection.

The following example creates a shard key on the ``belongs_to`` association in a
``Person`` model. Because the associated ``country`` collection has a primary
key called ``country_id``, {+odm+} shards by that field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/configuration/sharding.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-shard-key-association
   :end-before: # end-shard-key-association

You can specify a shard key on an embedded document by using dot notation to
delimit the field names. The following example creates a shard key on the
``address.city`` field:

.. literalinclude:: /includes/configuration/sharding.rb
   :language: ruby
   :start-after: # start-shard-key-embedded
   :end-before: # end-shard-key-embedded

.. note::

   Because the ``.`` character is used to delimit embedded fields, {+odm+} does
   not support creating shard keys on fields with names that contain the ``.``
   character.

Sharding Management Rake Tasks
------------------------------

You can shard collections in your database according the the shard keys defined
in your {+odm+} models by running the ``db:mongoid:shard_collections`` Rake
task. To ensure that the collections contain indexes that start with the shard
key, you can first run the ``db:mongoid:create_indexes`` Rake task.

Run the following Rake commands to create the indexes and shard the collections
based on your model's shard keys:

.. code-block:: bash

   rake db:mongoid:create_indexes
   rake db:mongoid:shard_collections

Index management and sharding rake tasks do not stop when they encounter an
error with a particular model class. Instead, they log the error and continue
processing the next model. To ensure the rake tasks did not encounter any
errors, check the output of {+odm+} logger configured for your application.

.. note::

   When performing schema-related operations in a sharded cluster, nodes might
   have out of date local configuration-related cache data. To clear the caches,
   run the :manual:`flushRouterConfig </reference/command/flushRouterConfig/>`
   command on each ``mongos`` node.
